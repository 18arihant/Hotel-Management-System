# Hotel-Management-System
Hotels are present everywhere across the country. But have you ever thought how these hotels are managed? Management of these hotels with the old existing manual management system has become a tedious and tiresome work due to increase in number of both the customers and variety of services provided to the customer. Thus, in order to avoid errors while entering customer details and calculating total bill, I have created a “Hotel management system” which is systematic, modular designed, selective menu based user display. it is made by focusing on the maintaining records employee’s actions in a computerized system rather than time taking and cumbersome manual system. It contains all the basic functions which include entering customer’s data, calculating room rent, restaurant bill, laundry bill and total bill. In this front end is python and backend is mysql.
